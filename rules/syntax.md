# Code Syntax

Severity: **Rule**

-

##### Description

Your code syntax must match the specifications listed below.

-

#####Notes

- A linter tool will check your code syntax within a process that will be executed automatically every time you raise a Pull Request.
- Github comments regarding bad-formed syntax in your Pull Requests will be automatically generated by [hound.ci](https://houndci.com/) tool.
- Your Pull Requests will not be approved until you fix all those comments, if there are.
- Reviewers should not care about syntax; there is the aforementioned automatic process for that.
- **This feature is still TBD.**

##### Motivation

- Convention
  - Defining and sticking with a style guide helps reduce the amount of decisions that developers needs to make when writing code, helping to keep their focus on logic, not semantics and formatting.
- Consistency
  - When every line of code is written in the same style, the whole codebase becomes easier to read, understand and de-bug. It also helps prevent areas of the codebase from being “owned” by one person's unique style vs. the team.
- Awesomeness
  - A clean codebase is a reflection of a cohesive team. It gives the impression of a team working well together towards a common goal, rather than individual developers working independently.
